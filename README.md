## Installation

To install everything, simply run `rake install`.

## Customizations

This project includes customizations for the following:

* **OSX** Increase keyboard repeat speed & set finder preferences
* **Git** Aliases & Config
* **ZSH** Aliases & Powerline-based theme
* **Vim** Bundles, Keybindings & Config
* **tmux** Keybindings & Config

### Keybinding Context...

I use OSX for development. I also use other tools and applications on my Mac that all have their own set of standard commands, for things like tab switching. I'm also only starting to use some of these tools (Vim, tmux), and have already been using my own personal set of commands for all my other editors for years. Not to mention, since I've been using these 2-3 key commands for years, I'm quick with them, and I already know them well.

## Other stuff

* Thanks to @hpoydar and @draper, many of these customizations are based on their dotfiles
